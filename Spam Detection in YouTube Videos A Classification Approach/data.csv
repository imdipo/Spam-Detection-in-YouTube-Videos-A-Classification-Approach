Almost 2 years ago, I saw a video that Steve Mould made about something called an atomic trampoline and the moment that I saw it, I really wanted to one. The only sad part is that it is now impossible to buy one, so instead, I decided to just make one myself.

Willem Dafoe is one of the most iconic, versatile, and stylish actors out there. From his iconic performance as the green goblin in Spider-Man and playing in American Psycho to The Lighthouse, Finding Nemo, and numerous Wes Anderson films, the range of this man’s filmography is something every actor dreams of. Dafoe is loved by viewers young and old, dominating Letterboxd as the most-watched actor in 2021 and 2022. But despite being in the industry for nearly 50 years, he has yet to win a single Oscar. Therefore, I feel like it’s about time to shine some light on this man's legendary career, have a closer look at his unique performances, and see why Willem Dafoe is an actor you simply cannot replace.

In this video, we dive deep into the evolution of Batman as a character across various films, exploring how each adaptation amplifies the mythos of the Dark Knight, making him increasingly complex and captivating. The analysis covers the use of cinematic language, artistic direction, and faithful comic book adaptation, which together have shaped Batman into an enduring icon.

We start with Tim Burton’s gothic interpretation in the 1989 film, where Michael Keaton’s portrayal set a new standard for the character, blending darkness and heroism. The video then transitions to Christopher Nolan’s critically acclaimed trilogy, focusing on Christian Bale’s nuanced performance and how Nolan's direction grounded Batman in a more realistic, gritty world. Special attention is given to the cinematic techniques and themes that make these films resonate deeply with audiences.

The discussion also highlights Ben Affleck’s portrayal in the DC Extended Universe, examining how his version of Batman, under the direction of Zack Snyder, reflects a more battle-worn and morally conflicted hero. Finally, the video looks at Robert Pattinson’s recent take on the character in Matt Reeves’ ""The Batman,"" showcasing a younger, more detective-oriented Batman, with a focus on the film’s noir aesthetic and psychological depth.

Throughout the video, key directors like Tim Burton, Christopher Nolan, Zack Snyder, and Matt Reeves are mentioned, alongside the actors who have brought Batman to life, analyzing how each has contributed to the legend of the Caped Crusader.

Le nom du groupe Cigarettes After Sex évoque tout à la fois la sensualité, l'intime, la mélancolie... Une imagerie qui correspond à merveille à la musique de ces quatre américains. Mené par Greg Gonzales, Cigarettes After Sex s'illustre en effet par une dream pop où l'épure de l'orchestration est proportionnelle à l'émotion provoquée par ces ballades enivrantes. Une ambiance claire-obscure qui n'est pas sans rappeler leurs compatriotes de Beach House.

C’est à la fin du mois d’octobre 2019 que Cigarettes After Sex a publié son deuxième album. Ce nouvel opus baptisé Cry nous transporte dans un univers nocturne et sensuel, éminemment cinématographique. C’est cet esprit que ce concert privé tente de retranscrire au travers de son atmosphère intimiste et de ses images en noir et blanc.

Glissez-vous dans l’univers de Cigarettes After Sex.

Concert capté le 6 novembre 2019 aux Magasins Généraux, Pantin.

BADBADNOTGOOD: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,BADBADNOTGOOD: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ap4DtvUu7Bk,"Bobby Carter | January 23, 2017 — BADBADNOTGOOD made a name for itself by reworking songs from the likes of Nas and Ol' Dirty Bastard, eventually catching the attention of Odd Future leader Tyler, the Creator. The masses took notice in 2015 when the group produced an entire LP for Ghostface Killah, Sour Soul. BADBADNOTGOOD has been called a hip-hop ensemble, but its foundation is clearly jazz, which provides a gateway to countless genres. On IV, the group allows that gateway to widen, adding soul and funk to the repertoire.

Still only in their 20s, the band's members never seemed intimidated by the intimate nature of the Tiny Desk; if anything, it accentuated their enthusiasm. This was their zone. They played three selections from IV — including ""Cashmere,"" which only slightly veered from the studio version, and ""In Your Eyes,"" which features Charlotte Day Wilson's vocals. The tight arrangement allowed Wilson to hover gently above the instrumentation, showing off the band's most promising work to date. It was a pleasure to have BADBADNOTGOOD at the desk for IV — and exciting to imagine what's in store for V, VI and beyond.

The video begins by exploring Serkis's iconic role as Gollum in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, where he revolutionized motion capture technology and brought a beloved literary character to life with unparalleled depth and emotion. We witness the evolution of Serkis's craft through his mesmerizing portrayal of Caesar in the ""Planet of the Apes"" reboot series, where his motion capture performances garnered critical acclaim and redefined the boundaries of what is possible in acting.

As the narrative unfolds, we journey through Serkis's diverse filmography, from his captivating performance as King Kong to his chilling portrayal of Supreme Leader Snoke in the ""Star Wars"" sequel trilogy. Each role showcases Serkis's unparalleled versatility and his ability to imbue even the most fantastical characters with humanity and complexity.",165K,11:55,Lancelloti,85.9K subscribers,"6,626,660 views 20 May 2024 #andyserkis #gollum #planetoftheapes"

How do you grow after making mistakes and enduring pain? What is your favorite thing about Iroh?

Licensed therapist Jonathan Decker and filmmaker Alan Seawright are reacting to Avatar: The Last Airbender again but with a twist. Jonathan is going toe-to-toe with Uncle Iroh… or agreeing with Iroh because he’s the GOAT. They talk about all the things that make Iroh so great, such as his humility and wisdom but also how he handles his mistakes and regrets. Alan dares Jonathan to find anything to criticize about Iroh. Will he come up with anything?

We're Chris W. Smith and Jack De Sena (aka Chris & Jack). We've been friends for years and love making high-quality, high-concept sketch comedy. Chris was a Blue Man in Blue Man Group. Jack voiced Sokka in Avatar the Last Airbender. In 2016 we united to create this channel, confusingly titled “Chris & Jack”, which has served as a shared platform to write, produce, direct, edit, and star in our own stuff. Also, we were also ghosts the whole time you were reading this. Supernatural twist!

Drawing some inspiration from vexing current events, we find that creative, structured thought on adjacent (but frivolous) problems is a sort of digestive act, and one that is ultimately laxative.

Errata (thanks to all pedantic viewers who catch this stuff):
 - I got the escape velocity off by a factor of 1000! It's 11 km/sec, not 11,000 km/sec. I think the other calculations are correct; I just mistook a period for a comma in my bleary-eyed late-night editing.
 - I got the size of the genome wrong due to a very silly bug from bleary-eyed late-night programming. It is 29903 base pairs, which can be stored in an economy-sized 7476 bytes.

when the actors don't hate the director…,when the actors don't hate the director…,https://youtube.com/watch?v=JR3hzUtJKYA,"Scott Pilgrim vs the World (2010) went from box-office bomb to cult-classic in less than a decade, and is celebrated for director Edgar Wright's unique style - mashing genres together with dynamic set pieces, editing, acting, and music. 

But there are too many video essays about that, so today I want to highlight another of Wright's overlooked qualities as a director: making a movie shoot fun.

On the morning of February 7th, 2016, director of Bangladesh Bank Zubair Bin Huda, takes the elevator and gets off on the 10th floor. He walks briskly into the most restricted part of the building, his mind fixated on the problem that has plagued his office for the past couple of days – the printer. This isn’t just any printer: It’s an automated machine hooked up to the bank's software, designed to print transaction reports instantly, automatically, and 24/7.

This printer was a big deal, and the empty tray represented a huge problem. After troubleshooting the issue for two days, the printer finally comes back online! But then, a backlog of more than expected reports started rolling out, and it was soon obvious that something wasn’t right. The New York Federal reserve received instructions to drain their entire account. Panic erupted as employees rushed to stop the transaction, but it was likely too late. – Bangladesh had just lost 1 billion dollars.",22K,15:57,Cipher,37.3K subscribers,"559,729 views 27 Jun 2024 #hacker #heist #cybercrime"

SQUALAY would never... because they're more into rap and hip-hop, not because they don't have the talent. Calm your farm
Lots of added reverb, echo, distortion, even a phaser effect on The Tourist - so no, my voice definitely isn't THAT versatile lol
But overall my Thom Yorke impression is the best imitation of a vocalist that I've been able to do so far (though that might not be saying very much)

Is OK COMPUTER The Best Album Ever?,Is OK COMPUTER The Best Album Ever?,https://youtube.com/watch?v=nYYMIYWEdwQ,"Stop being a paranoid android and start doing the work you love with Skillshare: https://skl.sh/middle8-13

In 1997, Radiohead released OK Computer.

It took them from a notable British act to the most important rock band on the planet. It was profoundly human, compositionally creative and carried themes that are just as -- if not more potent today -- as they were 20 years ago. OK Computer marked the end of an era, setting a new path for rock music. Without it, Muse, Coldplay or Arcade Fire wouldn’t exist as they do now. 

In Radiohead’s attempt to subvert mainstream trends and conventions, they ironically became more successful for it. Creating their most conceptually important release and one of the greatest albums of all time.

The success of OK Computer had the band set out on an ambitious tour, with their largest performance set on the Glastonbury stage. It was riddled with technical problems -- a complete nightmare for Thom Yorke who was already burnt out on playing the album’s material. But it was a tour that wouldn’t end for another year and a half.

The mindless cycle of creating albums then touring them was destroying Radiohead. When they had finally gotten to a place where they could take a break and not be forgotten, Thom was left catatonic. Experiencing intense depression, the success and subsequent tour of OK Computer put his mental state in a place he never wanted to be. OK Computer had become an instant classic, but now expectations for a worthy follow up were high, as critics and audiences looked at Radiohead to carry the genre forward.

In their pursuit, Radiohead suffered bouts of writer’s block, leading to self-doubt and the near break-up of the band. Had they released another album in the same vein as OK Computer or The Bends, they might have become the biggest band in the world. Instead, they released Kid A in quite possibly the greatest left turn in music history.

The Radiohead Effect,The Radiohead Effect,https://youtube.com/watch?v=1wIkL0tPi-o,"Only a handful of bands truly command attention and analysis when one of their songs enters a scene. Radiohead is undoubtedly one of these bands. Sure, two of their key members are successful film composers and their unique sound definitely lends itself to cinema, but it’s more than that.

Radiohead’s music is hard to define. It weaves in and out of various genres; it’s distant yet comforting; it’s harsh yet beautiful and poetic. But maybe most importantly, Radiohead’s music makes us think. Listen to any random track and you can immediately tell that an extraordinary amount of thought went into every single note and word. When one of these songs accompanies a scene, this thoughtfulness bleeds into the narrative. In short, Radiohead’s songs are the keys to opening doors that filmmakers didn’t think they could open.

If you’re as fascinated as we are about how a great composer can elevate a film, don’t miss our “Score Auteur” series, featuring Radiohead’s own Jonny Greenwood, Hans Zimmer, and Trent Reznor. And follow up those great videos with our article on the aesthetic of the late, great Jóhann Jóhannsson.",62K,6:33,Fandor,195K subscribers,"1,378,990 views 8 Oct 2018"

It's been a minute, hasn't it?
But I'm back! And my Indie 2D Speedrun Platformer Game has never been better! 

As we go through this story together, I'll analyse my own art through the lenses of Games like Undertale, Celeste, Ghostrunner, Ultrakill, Hollow Knight, and many more. 

It's also a video about the importance of Speedrunning. Strata is similar to games like Neon White in that it's designed around speedrunning (as opposed to classic speed games like the early Legend of Zelda games, where speedrunning was a happy accident).
I make heavy reference to the wider speedrun scene, like Trackmania, Sonic the Hedgehog, Games Done Quick and all sorts.

I want to start out by thanking fellow Indie Game Developer/ Gamedev YouTuber  @JuniperDev  for the initial inspiration for this Devlog Video Essay thing. 

It was a fantastic video, and its virality is very much deserved. It spoke to me specifically because the entirety of Strata is built on some incredibly janky code. So, this video is about me accepting my limitations as a developer, and how doing so lead to a really unique take on the platformer genre.

Also, the ‪@GMTK‬ Game Jam is happening right now!!! If it weren't for the fact I just spent like three weeks working tirelessly to prepare the game for this video and need a break, I would very much be jumping in. They've made it a four-day game jam this time, which I think is a fantastic decision that makes what was already the most accessible jam even more so. 
Thanks for inspiring so many people. It wasn't so long ago that I was the absolute novice stumbling upon your videos for the first time. Same goes for you, ‪@Brackeys‬. 


Games you should check out cause I like the people who made them:

In this video, we dive into the wild journey of John McAfee, from his early days as a coder to becoming a notorious figure in the tech world. We start with a step-by-step guide on uninstalling McAfee antivirus software, then shift to explore the fascinating and controversial life of McAfee himself. This video uncovers the chaos and intrigue that defined his life, from his groundbreaking work in antivirus software to his bizarre ventures and legal troubles. With a mix of historical footage, movie clips, and insider interviews, we unravel the enigmatic story of a man who lived on the edge of technology and controversy.

Exclusive videos every week about tech, behind the scenes of how I make videos and building stuff on the internet

All we hear about today is big tech companies worth trillions of dollars that make big moves and change the world, so much so that many people that is what tech is. But there's a whole other side of tech companies that most people don't even know about, with unique stories that break the mold of the traditional Silicon Valley model, and they are changing the way new tech companies are built. From Midjourney's and David Holz's crazy wild ride, to the new wave of indie hackers

🖖 Hey! I'm Enrico and on this channel I go behind the scenes of the design, psychology and stories behind tech and making stuff on the internet. I'm a tech Product Manager,  builder of digital stuff, YouTube aficionado (and overall meme connoisseur). I am also a rare Italian who doesn’t know how to cook.

We're Chris W. Smith and Jack De Sena (aka Chris & Jack). We've been friends for years and love making high-quality, high-concept sketch comedy. Chris was a Blue Man in Blue Man Group. Jack voiced Sokka in Avatar the Last Airbender. In 2016 we united to create this channel, confusingly titled “Chris & Jack”, which has served as a shared platform to write, produce, direct, edit, and star in our own stuff. Also, we were also ghosts the whole time you were reading this. Supernatural twist!

🔍 Your Web Browser is Dumb….without DNS🔍
Did you know your web browser is clueless when it comes to finding websites? When you type in a URL like academy.networkchuck.com, your browser has no idea where to go. That's where DNS, the Domain Name System, steps in to save the day! 🌐

In this video, we dive deep into the magic behind DNS. We'll break down how your browser queries DNS servers to turn website names into IP addresses, making the internet work seamlessly. From how DNS can be hacked to how you can secure your own DNS with tools like SecureDNS from TwinGate, we've got it all covered. 💻

🔐 DNS Security Tips: Learn how to use DNS over HTTPS (DOH), DNS over TLS (DOT), and other methods to keep your browsing secure from hackers and prying eyes. Protect your privacy and keep your internet safe.

🛠️ Tools Mentioned:
TwinGate for SecureDNS
Raspberry Pi for DIY DNS servers
AdGuard and PiHole for ad-blocking and DNS control

How to make Decisions in Javascript | Javascript If...else Statements,How to make Decisions in Javascript | Javascript If...else Statements,https://youtube.com/watch?v=hwFepsEzFhE,"I still remember the first time I learnt how to write and use an if-else statement in JavaScript. It was like discovering a superpower— I could make my code ""think"" and decide what to do based on different scenarios.

if-else statements are one of the backbones of decision-making in code. Whether you’re checking user input, validating data, or just deciding what message to display, these statements let you control the flow of your program with precision.

This Video thoroughly explains the concept and use of if-else statements in JavaScript. If you’re looking to see some real-world examples in action, this video is for you.

Timestamps:
0:00 Introduction
1:02 Basic Example
3:15 Complex Example (Else statement)
4:50 Else If Statements
7:48 Real-life Example
10:40 Alternatives to If Else Statement

Better then wolves is a mod from 1.5.2 where the player is tasked with TERRIBLE TIMES. It essentially takes every fun part of the game and turns it into a grueling nightmare while taking every bad thing about minecraft and making it a little more bad. Enjoy my surfacing.

A challenge 4 years in the making. We, along with the help of the Poly Bridge community, beat Poly Bridge 1, Poly Bridge 2, and Poly Bridge 3 only using road, wood, and steel. No hydraulics, springs, rope, cable, or foundation were used on any level and every level was completed underbudget and unbreaking.

Massive thank you to everyone who helped research for this video and anyone who made any solves for the challenge.

How to break bad habits - talk with @ThePrimeagen Senior Software Engineer at Netflix​: 
With over 195 million paid memberships in 190 countries, Netflix is the world’s leading entertainment service by a long shot. 
If you know something’s bad for you, why can’t you just stop? About 70% of smokers say they would like to quit. Drug and alcohol abusers struggle to give up addictions that hurt their bodies and tear apart families and friendships. And many of us have unhealthy excess weight that we could lose if only we would eat right and exercise more. So why don’t we do it?

4Chan VS Mexico's Most Dangerous Cartel,4Chan VS Mexico's Most Dangerous Cartel,https://youtube.com/watch?v=3LHuWZ-pBuw,"The year is 2011, and the Los Zetas cartel is one of the most powerful organizations in the modern world. Known for their brutalness, this Mexican cartel had been responsible for numerous massacres, wiping out whole villages of people. From lavish drug kingpins to even a human trafficking ring, Los Zetas is filled with highly trained individuals, many of whom were former members of Mexico’s special forces.

At this point, Los Zetas owned about a third of Mexico, along with many paid-off politicians, and businessmen, they even had a web of taxi drivers, who would feed them information, so they knew exactly where everyone was. So they could keep tabs on where their enemies are located.

Los Zetas used their immense power and wealth to stay in the shadows, hidden from the public view. Because of this, the Los Zetas cartel felt truly invincible. 

However, they would soon be thrust into the spotlight, when 4Chan’s hacker group, Anonymous declared war. But before we get to that, our story goes back around one year prior, at the end of  2010.

In this video, I explore the controversial topic of YouTube's recommendation algorithm and its potential to steer viewers towards extreme, alt-right content. 

Starting with a neutral  video, follow my journey through suggested videos to see how long it takes before the algorithm recommends content from the alt-right. We analyze the patterns, discuss the implications, and consider what this means for viewers and content creators alike. 

Is YouTube's algorithm inadvertently pushing users towards radicalization? Watch to find out!

🎧     Gibran Alcocer   Idea 10 Piano Mix    1 Hour Loop  
 
It was a cool evening, with autumn's golden leaves falling gently to the ground. The sunset painted the sky in shades of crimson and orange as the city slowly cloaked itself in darkness. In a small restaurant by the window, flickering candlelight danced on the tables, while the walls were adorned with paintings from a bygone era. This place, where two people would share the most intimate moment of their lives, held a warm atmosphere filled with the echoes of the past.

Defne and Emre had visited this restaurant many times over the years. Every table held memories—happy days, moments of joy, even small arguments... But tonight was different. Tonight was their last dinner together.

When Emre sat across from Defne, his eyes filled with unshed tears. His heart was not ready to accept this farewell. But life sometimes requires making the hardest decisions. There was sadness in Defne's eyes, but there was also a calmness, a dignity in how she faced this farewell. The soft music of the restaurant filled the room, as if trying to ease their pain.

In the center of the table stood a delicate vase of white roses. Emre had chosen these roses specifically. White symbolized purity and innocence—the purest and most innocent form of their love. But it also took on a meaning as a symbol of their parting.

The first course was served, and they both tried to savor the food. But each bite felt like a drop of sorrow falling into their hearts. Defne reached out and gently squeezed Emre's hand. ""I will remember this moment forever,"" she said. Her voice trembled slightly, but the determination in her eyes showed that she had come to terms with this farewell.

Emre did everything he could not to hurt her. ""You know,"" Emre began, never breaking eye contact with Defne, ""I fell in love with you here for the first time. That day, sitting in this restaurant with you, I imagined spending a lifetime together."" Defne's eyes filled with tears, but she did not cry. Because tonight was not a time for mourning, but a celebration of the deep love they had for each other.

Throughout the meal, they shared beautiful memories from the past. The day they first met, the vacations they took together, the sweet words they exchanged... Each memory made their love more meaningful, and saying goodbye even harder.

When dessert arrived, Emre pulled out a small box from his pocket. Inside was a delicate gold bracelet, inscribed with the words, ""Always in my heart."" Defne could no longer hold back her tears as she accepted this final gift. As Emre fastened the bracelet around her wrist, he whispered, ""This is our eternity. Though we may be apart in body, our souls will always be together.""

Then came the moment they had both been avoiding all night. The moment of parting. As they walked towards the door of the restaurant, it felt as though time had stopped. Outside, a cold wind was blowing, but inside, they felt the warmth of the love they had for each other. Emre took Defne in his arms one last time and placed a gentle kiss on her hair. ""I will always love you,"" he whispered. Defne rested her head on his chest and took a deep breath. ""I know,"" was all she said. Because sometimes words fail to capture the depth of the heart.

As Emre let go of Defne for the last time, a single tear rolled down his cheek. But it was not a tear of sorrow, but of gratitude; gratitude for the years they spent together, for the memories they shared, and most importantly, for the pure love they had for each other.

As the night wore on, Defne walked away. Emre watched her go for the last time, and then left with an emptiness in his heart. But he knew that this emptiness would never fully be filled. Because some loves are not completed by time, but only in eternity.

Anime's single most motivating line (Tanaka Ryūnosuke),Anime's single most motivating line (Tanaka Ryūnosuke),https://youtube.com/watch?v=HR0tggNVxXc,"It's very common nowadays for people to use anime for motivation - listening to soundtracks in the gym, watching big scenes before a big moment IRL, or just rewatching THAT moment when we're at a low point. I could name countless motivational anime quotes or scenes, but of all of them, my favourite is undoubtedly ""Tanaka's Greatest Moment"" - his cross shot against Inarizaki to win the first set.

Tanaka's whole speech about how he's ""Nothing but average"", and therefore has  is something that's always really inspired me. During my absolute lowest moments, his following line is one that's played in my head again and again.

Anime's most inspiring philosophy (Shinsuke Kita),Anime's most inspiring philosophy (Shinsuke Kita),https://youtube.com/watch?v=0AY7--sT9YY,"There's plenty of ""motivational"" or ""inspirational"" anime characters out there. There's a few I would genuinely credit with changing my life. However many of those, had huge amounts of screentime - or at the very least a good few episodes. But Shinsuke Kita, has barely more than an episode.

Of all of Haikyuu's quotes, perhaps my favourite is ""You do it every day. You take care of your body. You tidy your environment. You practice gratitude. And you practice"". Shinsuke's arrival is one of the most pivotal moments for Haikyuu, that took everything that the events of the previous matches, in particular Karasuno vs Aoba Johsai, and turned it into something even more beautiful.

Karasuno vs Inarizaki is one of the most intense arcs I've ever seen, from moments such as Hinata's receive, Tanaka's spike and even ""Let's take it easy"", it's packed full of some of my favourite moments in anime.

This training arc makes life feel good again (Haikyuu),This training arc makes life feel good again (Haikyuu),https://youtube.com/watch?v=ILQvgQDlBAw,"Hinata's Brazil arc is without doubt my favourite training arc of all time. Haikyuu is packed to the brim with inspiring stories, and this arc is perhaps the most moving of all. From the end of Karasuno vs Kamomedai, where Takeda told him ""This is still Volleyball"", to his graduation and then moving to Brazil to practice beach volleyball, Hinata went on a crazy journey, which we'll discuss today.

Hinata's trip to Brazil didnt start the way he hoped, his roommate ignored him, the sand took away his jumping power... and yet he continued on.

After a particularly awful day, where he had his wallet stolen he becomes overwhelmed by homesickness. But it's here he remembers Takeda's words, ""He who would climb the ladder, must start at the bottom"". Said to him during the ball boy arc, a reminder of his need to work his way up. But more importantly, to take care of himself. After collapsing halfway through the Kamomedai match, and being told by Hoshiumi to ""play him again"", he goes on a whole new path. One where he prioritises taking care of himself. Lifting weights, meditating, eating good food. All things we should do ourselves.

After meeting up with Oikawa, and playing matches of beach volleyball together, including the final of a tournament, Hinata heads home and joins the MSBY Black Jackacls, where they play the Schweiden Adlers, featuring Kageyama, Ushiwaka, Hoshiumi and more.

Hinata kicks off the match with a reverse tempo set with teammate Miya Atsumu, resulting in his iconic ""I'm here""! line. And as the match continutes, ""Ninja Shoyo"" takes over the court. Being able to fight against a world-class ace like Romero, recieving even Ushiwaka's hate filled spike, and showing himself to be a secret setter. But most importantly, at the very end, he manages to beat Kageyama. Showing that everything that happened this whole time, was ""Still volleyball"".

"The ""villain"" I wanted to win (Oikawa Toru) [REUPLOAD]","The ""villain"" I wanted to win (Oikawa Toru) [REUPLOAD]",https://youtube.com/watch?v=cKpGHflOfNQ,"Oikawa's ""Chance Ball"" scene is one of Haikyuu's greatest, but it's just a small part of his incredible journey. As perhaps the most motivating character in the anime, his journey as an ""Ordinary setter"" to fight against Karasuno's Kageyama, and Aoba Johsai's Shiratorizawa is beyond inspiring.

From the first match of Aoba Johsai vs Karasuno, where his serves were near-unstoppable, we see Oikawa's drastic development before the season 2 rematch. He's a completely different player, with a whole new mindset that he picked up from his mentor Jose Blanco, he turns into an absolute monster.

He's completely overcome his past - which we see in the flashback he has to his middle school days, where he almost hit Kageyama out of anger.

And yet, in spite of all of that, he ends the second season, his time at high school, with no appearances at nationals. And yet when he finds Ushiwaka, he declares that his ""Volleyball career isn't close to over yet"".

(Spoilers in this paragraph) We see him in the background of the Karasuno vs Inaraizaki match, but we otherwise don't see him - until MUCH later on, post Haikyuu's timeskip - where he and Hinata meet in Brazil to play Beach Volleyball. Further down the line, Oikawa joins Argentina's national team under the leadership of Jose Blanco, where they then play Japan. The winner of that match is seemingly never revealed, but chapter 402.1 gives us the final answer - Oikawa beat everyone.

He is a unique character with a unique story, and damn is it inspiring as all hell.

Close your eyes
Don't let our yearning hurt this moment
Feel the skies
For the next destination is our motherland

Home, to me
Is more missed in such a moment

Head to the place where the embrace of my love is always near
Place where I am unconditionally accepted
Where it is fine to shed my tears and woe
Oh none of the places can be warm as our home

Clear clouds embroidered with coral on my way up
Glimmering tides will get louder as I go on
Flying home, here I am flying home
Oh none of the places can be warm as our home

Gently tidied up our nest
And made some sweet stew; I tried my best
Ducks glide above in flock like a sea

Elating moment was when I

How to think like A GENIUS Programmer,How to think like A GENIUS Programmer,https://youtube.com/watch?v=kQUwImj32PA,"The Secret to Coding Is Thinking Like A Programmer, Which I will explain In this video.

This video is all about the learning process and the mindset you need to become a successful programmer or learn to code in general. Sometimes we need a reminder on most basic things that we have already heard a million times. This video won't make you a professional coder/programmer, but I hope it helps at least even one person to have the right mindset. This is how to think like a GENIUS programmer. 

HUGE inspiration from: Fireship, BigBoxSWE, TheCodingSloth, ModernIdeas, and ThisScience. They're amazing YouTubers, that you should check out. I loved their content and tried my best to make a mix of their styles.

Here's some SEO Spam:
This video is similar to fireship's,  How to learn to code - 8 hard truths, Or the coding sloth's, Learn How to Code Like a GENIUS and Not Waste Time. I was also inspired by BigBoxSwe's video: How to code everyday. So if you like those videos made by fireship, thecodingsloth, or bigboxswe, you might like this one. I also took huge inspiration from modern ideas and this.science. Overall this video is similar to fireship, thecodingsloth and bigboxswe, except it's made by lattice! So if you watched videos like, this is why programming is hard for you, or 20 programming projects that will make you good at coding or 9 programming lessons I wish I knew earlier, or you don't have to be smart to code. Then you will probably like this video too. This video is inspired by videos like: How I would learn to code if I could start over, Why you shouldn't nest your code, and naming things in code, reality of software engineering interns, how to become a coding machine, the art of linux clis, reality of cs majors, mindset of successful programmers, stop studying programming and much more. Overall, huge thanks to fireship, thecodingsloth and bigboxswe for the inspiration and I hope you enjoy this video.
 Topics Covered:
- Analysis of trends in programming careers
- What makes developers unhappy?
- Should I become a programmer?
- Should I get a CS degree?
- Drawbacks for working as a programmer
- Job outlook for software engineers
Editing inspired by: ModernIdeas, This.science, BigBoxSWE

As we navigate through the world, we are constantly being influenced by subtle design tactics that most of us aren't even aware of. These branding tactics can be found everywhere - in the layout of your favorite store, the colors of a pop-up ad, or even the design of your favorite app. But it's not just about understanding these principles. It's about considering the ethics behind their use, questioning the motives, and equipping ourselves to recognize and resist manipulation.

What crimes Jschlatt did in 1999 is impossible to fully describe. I tried my best to capture the horrors that Jebediah Schlatt, also known as JschlattLive and Big Guy, committed, but I merely grazed the surface. Schlagg is a so called ""streamer"" and ""YouTuber"" but that's simply a facade. He hides behind his fellow content creators, like Ted Nivison and the dream smp just so he doesn't have to face the horrendous things he did on 1999. But 1999 is just the start, there are rumors that Schlatt had certain connections to the Queen's unfortunate demise. Spread the word!

I covered 10 track of [Your Name.] soundtrack so far.
Looking back, I started playing ""Your Name"" in 2019. 
It was one of my favorite OST album, so I enjoyed playing it.
I wish I could make this kind of music in my life.
It is a version in which ten songs are repeated twice.

And I made a piano cover collection with these.
There are still more songs I want to play, but for those who are waiting, I've put together the performances I've been playing.
It is a version in which nine songs are repeated twice.

Watch the Q&A with Mirella here:    • Q&A: What is generative AI and how do...  

Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that involves creating new and original data or content. Unlike traditional AI models that rely on large datasets and algorithms to classify or predict outcomes, generative AI models are designed to learn the underlying patterns and structure of the data and generate novel outputs that mimic human creativity.

ChatGPT is perhaps the most well-known example, but the field is far larger and more varied than text generation. Other applications of generative AI include image and video synthesis, speech generation, music composition, and virtual reality.

In this lecture, Mirella Lapata will present an overview of this exciting—sometimes controversial—and rapidly evolving field.

Mirella Lapata is professor of natural language processing in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. Her research focuses on getting computers to understand, reason with, and generate natural language. She is the first recipient (2009) of the British Computer Society and Information Retrieval Specialist Group (BCS/IRSG) Karen Sparck Jones award and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the ACL, and Academia Europaea.

He has been an AI researcher for more than 30 years, and has published more than 400 scientific articles on the subject.

Discourses are one of the Ri’s oldest and most prestigious series of talks. Since 1825, audiences in the theatre have witnessed countless mind-expanding moments, including the first public liquefaction of air by James Dewar, the announcement of the electron by JJ Thomson and over 100 lectures by Michael Faraday. In more recent times, we have had Nobel laureates, Fields medal winners, scientists, authors and artists – all from the cutting-edge of their field. Discourses are an opportunity for the best and brightest to share their work with the world.

Steeped in nearly two centuries of tradition, a Discourse is more than just a lecture. The Discourse lasts exactly an hour, and a bell is rung to mark the beginning and end. To keep the focus on the topic, presenters begin sharply at 7:30pm without introduction and we lock the speaker into a room ten minutes ahead of the start (legend has it that a speaker once tried to escape!). Some of our guests and speakers dress smartly for our Discourse events to add to this sense of occasion.  Read more about Discourses here: https://www.rigb.org/explore-science/...

This talk was recorded at the Ri on 13 September 2023.

The information quantum computers can provide us with will be worlds away from standard computers. Because of this, the standard internet alone will not suffice in allowing us to access this quantum information; a quantum internet must be developed to keep up with the immense increase in computational power.

Join Kian van der Enden as he explores how we can build the internet the future will need, a quantum internet and whether it will be truly unhackable.

In this talk, discover everything about this exciting technology and its applications both for the quantum and current internet. From the usefulness of quantum teleportation to how this could shape our world.

P vs. NP: The Biggest Puzzle in Computer Science,P vs. NP: The Biggest Puzzle in Computer Science,https://youtube.com/watch?v=pQsdygaYcE4&t=21s,"Are there limits to what computers can do? How complex is too complex for computation? The question of how hard a problem is to solve lies at the heart of an important field of computer science called Computational Complexity. Computational complexity theorists want to know which problems are practically solvable using clever algorithms and which problems are truly difficult, maybe even virtually impossible, for computers to crack. This hardness is central to what’s called the P versus NP problem, one of the most difficult and important questions in all of math and science. 

This video covers a wide range of topics including: the history of computer science, how transistor-based electronic computers solve problems using Boolean logical operations and algorithms, what is a Turing Machine, the different classes of problems, circuit complexity, and the emerging field of meta-complexity, where researchers study the self-referential nature of complexity questions.

How AI Discovered a Faster Matrix Multiplication Algorithm,How AI Discovered a Faster Matrix Multiplication Algorithm,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fDAPJ7rvcUw,"Researchers at Google research lab DeepMind trained an AI system called AlphaTensor to find new, faster algorithms to tackle an age-old math problem: matrix multiplication. Advances in matrix multiplication could lead to breakthroughs in physics, engineering and computer science.

AlphaTensor quickly rediscovered - and surpassed, for some cases - the reigning algorithm discovered by German mathematician Volker Strassen in 1969. However, mathematicians soon took inspiration from the results of the game-playing neural network to make advances of their own.

Why Lego Is So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider,Why Lego Is So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider,https://youtube.com/watch?v=-d8sNML3WT8,"Lego is the world's largest toy company but it's gained a reputation for being an expensive hobby. Since 2007, Lego has released dozens of sets that cost over $300. The most expensive Star Wars sets cost $850. And prices for vintage Lego sets can reach over $1,000. These high prices have caught the attention of thieves, who in some cases have stolen about $300,000 worth of Lego. So, how did we get here? How did Lego go from a children's toy to a collector's item? And why is it so expensive?

Your vanilla extract? Well, that's probably just a lab-made derivative of crude oil. And your shaker of Parmesan cheese? It probably has wood pulp inside. 

You might feel the companies behind these food products are using deceptive packaging — but it's legal. However, there's a whole other level of trickery that's completely illegal: food fraud. That's when criminals bottle up corn syrup and call it 100% honey, or when they pass off cheap mozzarella as pure Parmigiano-Reggiano. 

Globally, the fraudulent food industry could be worth $40 billion. It hurts legitimate producers, funds criminal activities, and can even harm consumers. We head around the world to uncover how producers get away with food deception and how we can spot the real stuff.

Why Hagoromo Chalk Is So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider,Why Hagoromo Chalk Is So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider,https://youtube.com/watch?v=BORVxbsdkCM,"Hagoromo has been described as ""the Rolls-Royce"" of chalk."" The formerly Japanese, now Korean brand's chalk is known for its smooth consistency, vibrancy, and being nearly dust-free. But the brand almost disappeared in 2015, which sent its loyal fans into a frenzy, buying up lifetime supplies before the factory shut down. Luckily, Shin Hyeong-seok, a Korean schoolteacher and former seller of Hagoromo chalk, formed a relationship with the company's president, Watanabe Takayasu, and decided to take over. The transition wasn't easy, but Hyeong-seok's dedication to Takayasu's original formulas and methodology kept the brand alive. But is that enough to ensure its future? We visited Sejongmall, where Hagoromo chalk is made, to find out.

What's inside this crater in Madagascar?,What's inside this crater in Madagascar?,https://youtube.com/watch?v=h42QVfrUVFw,"On satellite imagery, we spotted a village inside a strange crater in Madagascar. We set out to learn how it got there.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Right in the center of the island nation of Madagascar there’s a strange, almost perfectly circular geological structure. It covers a bigger area than the city of Paris — and at first glance, it looks completely empty. But right in the center of that structure, there’s a single, isolated village: a few dozen houses, some fields of crops, and dirt roads stretching out in every direction. 

When we first saw this village on Google Earth, its extreme remoteness fascinated us. Was the village full of people? How did they wind up there? And what did life look like in such a strange geography? To find out, we teamed up with a local team in Madagascar and fell down a rabbit hole of geology and mapping along the way. It’s a story of how continental shifts and volcanic geology came together to form a place for a group of people to call home. 

Check out an extended look at the interviews in this video:    • Bonus interviews: What’s inside this ...  

We got to talk with a lot of experts along the way to make this piece. Here are links to some of their work:

Here is Ndivhuwo Cecilia Mukosi’s original paper on the Ambohiby Complex: https://www.researchgate.net/publicat...

Correction: At 2:52, we mistakenly labeled Lucienne Wilmé as a professor of geology at the University of Florida. In fact, she is a national coordinator of the Madagascar Program at the World Resources Institute.

Why would astrophysicists care about a two millennia old Roman shipwreck between the islands of Sardinia and Mal Di Ventre?

But behind this technological marvel lies a hidden reality. This documentary unveils the untold story of the ghost workers who power our digital world, performing the tedious and often traumatic tasks that machines can't handle.

Meet the invisible workforce behind tech giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Uber. These underpaid and disposable workers label images, moderate content, and train AI systems, often earning less than minimum wage. Their work is essential yet remains in the shadows, unacknowledged by the companies that depend on them.

Intro 00:00
There's a real need to shift thinking and business models and possibly, rather than selling it, equipment actually to sell services. So companies own equipment, so then they're responsible for maintenance and for what happens, either for extending life, which would be very much to their advantage, or for recycling, ending life.

Gael Duez 00:37
Hello everyone, welcome to Green IO with Gael Duez - that’s me! In this podcast we empower responsible technologists to build a greener digital world, one byte at a time. Twice a month on a Tuesday, our guests from across the globe share insights, tools, and alternative approaches, enabling people within the Tech sector and beyond, to boost Digital Sustainability.

And because accessible and transparent information is in the DNA of Green IO, all the references mentioned in this episode, as well as the transcript, will be in the show notes. You can find these notes on your favorite podcast platform, and, of course, on our website greenio.tech.

Can the data center industry become circular? Simple question, very complex answers.

Fueled by the ongoing artificial intelligence boom, data centers are popping up around the world like mushrooms after a good rain. For an industry which is more and more under scrutiny due to its environmental footprint, the sustainability angle cannot be overlooked anymore. Still, the main hurdle remains data, as many guests already stated in this podcast. Hence, my wish today to get insights from the program leader of an initiative which has managed to build high quality primary data on the data center industry. The CEDaCI project sounds like a Dan Brown book title, CEDaCI code to unveil all the mysterious power beneath our almighty data center industry. And to some extent, it's quite the plot. But I will let Deborah Andrews, professor at the Imperial College of London and a two decades long veteran in Circular Economy and Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment reveal all of it. 
Hi, Deborah. Thanks a lot for joining Green IO today.

Deborah Andrews 02:32
Thank you very much for inviting me.

Gael Duez 02:35
It's a pleasure. It's a pleasure. And I have a very direct question to ask you to kick start our discussion. Did you start the CEDaCI project out of frustration somehow?

Deborah Andrews 02:49
Okay, well, first of all, thank you for calling CEDaCI. That's the Italian interpretation. We normally describe it as CEDaCI, but hey ho, it's an acronym for the Circ...", 12345678901234567890123456789 ,55:48,Green IO,35 subscribers,9 views 3 Sept 2024 Green IO
The True Story of How GPT-2 Became Maximally Lewd,The True Story of How GPT-2 Became Maximally Lewd,https://youtube.com/watch?v=qV_rOlHjvvs,"In this video, we recount an incident that occurred at OpenAI while researchers were trying to finetune GPT-2 to be as helpful and ethical as possible. It's narrated that inadvertently flipping a single minus sign led GPT-2 to become the embodiment of a well-known cardinal sin.

- Graph is made with python-igraph
- Distributed Recursive Layout algorithm is used for the graph layout
- Leiden algorithm is used for community detection
- A valid article is any page in Wikipedia's article namespace excluding redirect pages, disambiguation pages, and soft redirects
- A valid link is a link in an articles body. Links that appear in or after the ""See Also"" section and links that appear as footnotes are not included since these are not really a part of the article's body. Links in and after the ""See Also"" section of pages are typically not used in Wikipedia races.

The saddest piece of art I’ve ever seen is about a robot.

Actually, it is a robot. It’s a mechanical arm by artists Sun Yuan and Peng Yu that must continually push a leaking liquid back into its body to function. And here’s the thing — I know, rationally, this art installation is not alive. Like every machine, it is, by definition, something artificial.

And no matter how advanced robots become, they’ll never have… souls. Right?

Euler’s Amazing 1747 Paper
Euler, Leonard. ""Sur les logarithmes des nombres négatifs et imaginaires” Written in 1747, but not published until 1862. Euler did publish a similar paper in 1749. See Cajori #3 above.

Note on Benroulli’s area of sectors
Euler’s counterexample using Bernoulli’s sector area comes in a couple flavors. The one presented in his 1747 paper ""Sur les logarithmes des nombres négatifs et imaginaires” is a bit different than an earlier example in a letter to Bernoulli. I chose the earlier example for clarity. See Cajori vol 2 and Sandifer.

Physicists have a pretty good handle on how stuff behaves on the surface of the Earth. But a lot of matter in the universe exists outside this narrow band of relatively low temperatures and pressures. Inside planets and stars, the crushing force of gravity begins to overwhelm the electromagnetic and nuclear forces that keep atoms apart and maintain the shapes of molecules. 

What happens next? Scientists (including a consortia of researchers at the NSF’s Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures​​) are just starting to figure that out. They use a variety of tools (including some humongous lasers) to simulate planetary cores and see what happens. A few standout findings so far:

Water can become a hot black ice that conducts electricity: https://www.quantamagazine.org/black-...

Hydrogen gas can be compressed down into a shiny metal: https://www.newscientist.com/article/...

Sodium (a soft, silvery metal at atmospheric pressure) can turn transparent: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases...

Presented by the Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures (CMAP) at the University of Rochester,
a National Science Foundation (NSF) Physics Frontier Center, Award PHY-2020249 https://cmap.rochester.edu/

What happens under extreme pressures deep with planets also influences their ability to foster life. Check out our videos about the search for Earth-like worlds beyond our solar system:

CORRECTIONS
- I didn't bother showing me locking cell references in the animations. Things like ""=B4/B2"" should have been ""=B4/$B$2"" so I could drag the formula down. We took that out in the interest of clarity.
- Yes, at 13:20 I say ""the divisor ceases to lose some of its strict meaning"" which is the opposite of what I meant! the sentence needs but the one negative. Either of these would work: ""the divisor loses some of its strict meaning"" OR ""the divisor ceases to have some of its strict meaning"".
- Sorry, at 16:47 column D is wrong. These are different numbers using 880 but the values over in E use the correct 930. It's just a display issue and does not change the results (despite being a bit confusing!). Spotted by a few people including Thomas Klemm  and AverageJon.
- People have mentioned that Theorem 2 (and the conclusion) from this 1974 paper by Balinski & Young has an Alabama-paradox-beating method. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.71.11.4602
- Let me know if you spot anything else.

How Millionaire Bankers Actually Work | Authorized Account | Insider,How Millionaire Bankers Actually Work | Authorized Account | Insider,https://youtube.com/watch?v=9GumiLIxLMM,"Gary Stevenson, the author of “The Trading Game,” spent his early 20s trading trillions of dollars for Citibank in London and Tokyo.

He claimed to have won the job playing a card game and eventually became Citibank’s most profitable trader. While some of his colleagues lived a life fueled by partying and cocaine, Gary earned millions betting against the global economy. He talks to Business Insider about office culture in Canary Wharf, London, the bosses, and the bonuses. He covers the mindset of profitable bankers, their daily routine, and what leaving the job is like.  

Now, Gary is a published author and teaches economics through his YouTube channel Garyseconomics.

How The CIA Actually Works | Authorized Account | Insider,How The CIA Actually Works | Authorized Account | Insider,https://youtube.com/watch?v=kUMQd30Xrhk,"Andrew Bustamante spent seven years working covertly as an officer in the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA recruited him while he was applying to join the Peace Corps after leaving the US Air Force. Bustamante possesses an intimate knowledge of the intelligence community's inner workings. He says that he orchestrated several drone strikes during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and that he mastered the art of deception. After meeting his wife, also a CIA officer, and having children, he learned the CIA was no place for families. But leaving a life that was, to most people, a lie wasn't easy. Today, he runs his own company, Everyday Spy, training people in the techniques he learned as a spy. But he believes the US isn't safe enough to raise his family.

Yes, Cryptos, aka sh*t coins, have no value. They are securities and not backed by anything. The same is true for NFTs and other tokens....but Bitcoin, really brother? 

If you're truly for the people, go back to the drawing board because you might find all the things you talk about lead back to Bitcoin.

How Money Laundering Actually Works | How Crime Works | Insider,How Money Laundering Actually Works | How Crime Works | Insider,https://youtube.com/watch?v=R5FSXCYrlt0,"Robert Mazur is a former government agent who investigated drug-money laundering for the US Drug Enforcement Administration, the Internal Revenue Service intelligence division, and the Customs Service. While deep undercover in hot spots such as Florida, Colombia, and Panama, Mazur successfully infiltrated criminal rings and cartels, including Pablo Escobar's, by posing as a wealthy, mob-connected businessman. He helped manage the illicit fortunes of the Medellín and Cali cartels while gathering evidence that would lead to some of the largest money-laundering prosecutions in history.

He speaks to Insider about how the cartels layer their assets, and move money via “smurfs”. He also covers the use of legitimate businesses, such as jewellery chains and mortgage brokerage companies.

Mazur is the author of ""The Infiltrator,"" which became a New York Times bestseller and inspired a 2016 film of the same title, starring Bryan Cranston (as Mazur) and John Leguizamo. Cranston is set to play Mazur again in the sequel currently in development, which is based on Mazur' second memoir, ""The Betrayal.” Today, Mazur speaks and consults around the world through his company, KYC Solutions.

Automotive parts manufactured in the morning, aerospace parts manufactured at noon: Machina Labs’ factory of the future is rethinking manufacturing with roboforming.

Roboforming is a revolutionary way of shaping metal using robots and artificial intelligence. To keep up with our ever-shifting digital world, manufacturing needs to deviate from the standard practices established decades ago that most of the industry is still following.

Machina Labs is taking manufacturing to the next level by making it more nimble and accessible, no huge factories required. They’re approaching the industry with one big idea: What if custom manufacturing could be just as affordable and efficient?

Inside Micron Taiwan’s Semiconductor Factory | Taiwan’s Mega Factories EP1,Inside Micron Taiwan’s Semiconductor Factory | Taiwan’s Mega Factories EP1,https://youtube.com/watch?v=WKHKy89QaV0,"Join us for a tour of Micron Technology’s Taiwan chip manufacturing facilities to discover how chips are produced and how innovations in the semiconductor industry impact people and businesses all over the world.

Take a look inside one of the semiconductor factories that make Taiwan the most significant site of semiconductor production in the world. Thanks to modern technology and constant innovations, chip manufacturing advances at a rapid pace. Today, each silicon microchip contains over 100 billion transistors, the switches that make up the basic units of computing. Each transistor is just a few nanometers in size, making them a fraction of the size of a human hair.

This means that even the slightest contamination can halt the entire chip production process. In fact, the semiconductor manufacturing process contains over 1,000 steps, all of which must be executed perfectly to produce functional chips. In Micron’s mega factory, silicon wafers are processed with incredible precision. The dustless factory is highly automated, which minimizes the number of humans required to enter. Each silicon wafer is coated in a UV-sensitive liquid, then etched using photolithography. We exhibit the entire process here in high resolution, giving you an inside look into the workings of one of the most high-tech factories in the world.

Micron Technology is a global leader in the semiconductor industry and produces leading-edge memory products. Its neighbor Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) produces industry-leading logic technology. These two companies constitute a large portion of the Taiwanese semiconductor industry, which spans the island from north to south. As they grow and continue to innovate, their products require more and more resources to produce, putting increasing pressure on the environment. Micron leaders share how they are expanding their innovative approach into the area of resource management, enabling them to create more sustainable products.

Could a 3D-robotic loom be the answer to making fast fashion faster and more sustainable? Unspun's patented loom (so proprietary that we had to blur it for the video) can create clothing that fits you seamlessly every time, with just a scan of your phone, and far less waste than other clothing production methods. 

Unspun is pioneering a different method of apparel production out of Oakland, California. By utilizing three-dimensional weaving, the start-up is building garments from the ground up, perfectly customized for the wearer's dimensions.

So, how could this technology reform one of the world's dirtiest industries? Follow us inside the company's headquarters to find out.

World's Fastest Camera Drone Vs F1 Car (ft. Max Verstappen),World's Fastest Camera Drone Vs F1 Car (ft. Max Verstappen),https://youtube.com/watch?v=9pEqyr_uT-k,"This is Formula 1 like you’ve never seen it before. The ‪@dutchdronegods‬ follow Max Verstappen’s brand new ‪@redbullracing‬  RB20 F1 car for a full lap of Silverstone’s Grand Prix Circuit. The world first uninterrupted FPV one shot was captured by a manually piloted custom built drone, designed specifically for the challenge of keeping up with the car at speeds of over 300kph.

It took Red Bull and the Dutch Drone Gods over a year to create a drone that can accelerate two times faster than an F1 car, reaching 300 km/h in just 4 seconds with a top speed of over 350 km/h. The development was accelerated by access to know-how and processes of Red Bull Advanced Technologies, a high-performance engineering arm of Oracle Red Bull Racing Formula 1 team and trialled behind the RB8 and RB19 cars driven by ‪@liamlawson30‬  and David Coulthard.

Node.js: The Documentary | An origin story,Node.js: The Documentary | An origin story,https://youtube.com/watch?v=LB8KwiiUGy0&t=132s,"Back in 2008, most people thought of JavaScript as just a client-side language. But when Google's V8 appeared, young developer Ryan Dahl made the connection between non-blocking servers, V8, and JavaScript. It was by combining these key elements that he was able to create the now hugely popular Node.js.

What young Ryan Dahl probably didn't expect was how much forking drama would follow.

Join us as we delve into the origins of Node.js, meet some of its earliest contributors and explore the complicated dynamics between corporations using open source technologies and the dedicated community members who fuel their progress. Featuring interviews with Ryan Dahl (creator of Node.js), Isaac Schlueter (creator of npm) and more.

The mind behind Linux | Linus Torvalds | TED,The mind behind Linux | Linus Torvalds | TED,https://youtube.com/watch?v=o8NPllzkFhE,"Linus Torvalds transformed technology twice — first with the Linux kernel, which helps power the Internet, and again with Git, the source code management system used by developers worldwide. In a rare interview with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Torvalds discusses with remarkable openness the personality traits that prompted his unique philosophy of work, engineering and life. ""I am not a visionary, I'm an engineer,"" Torvalds says. ""I'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and just staring at the clouds ... but I'm looking at the ground, and I want to fix the pothole that's right in front of me before I fall in.""

AlphaGo - The Movie | Full award-winning documentary,AlphaGo - The Movie | Full award-winning documentary,https://youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y,"With more board configurations than there are atoms in the universe, the ancient Chinese game of Go has long been considered a grand challenge for artificial intelligence. 

On March 9, 2016, the worlds of Go and artificial intelligence collided in South Korea for an extraordinary best-of-five-game competition, coined The DeepMind Challenge Match. Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history.

Directed by Greg Kohs and with an original score by Academy Award nominee Hauschka, AlphaGo had its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. It has since gone on to win countless awards and near universal praise for a story that chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?

Best documentary winner: Denver International Film Festival (2017), Warsaw International Film Festival (2017), and Traverse City Film Festival (2017).

Official selection at Tribeca Film Festival (2017), BFI London Film Festival (2017), and Critics' Choice Documentary Awards (2017).

The Only Time Where Kronii Has Ever Gotten a Perfect 50/50 in a Poll【Hololive EN ID | Kronii x Kaela,The Only Time Where Kronii Has Ever Gotten a Perfect 50/50 in a Poll【Hololive EN ID | Kronii x Kaela,https://youtube.com/watch?v=CGuCMlCuX74,"Kronii and Kaela wants to decide on a tag that they will be using in the future collab. After the first poll, Kronii decides the tag to be ""Kroela"", but Kronii saw someone suggests ""Timesmith"". Apparently the comment section got divided to a perfect 50/50 on deciding whether it should be ""Timesmith"" or ""Kroela"". Kronii asked Kaela to decide, but she doesn't want to. So, they decide using a spinning wheel. ""Timesmith"" will be the next tag.

I dunno whose comment she read about Timesmith, but I do hope that she read mine. (At least, let me believe...)

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",279K,17:34,TEDx Talks,41.4M subscribers,"7,251,804 views 9 Dec 2013"

Is consciousness an illusion? 5 experts explain,Is consciousness an illusion? 5 experts explain,https://youtube.com/watch?v=BjmPvovl-V4,"“If science aims to describe everything, how can it not describe the simple fact of our existence?” On this episode of Dispatches, Kmele speaks with the scientists, mathematicians, and spiritual leaders trying to do just that:

This video is an episode from ‪@The-Well‬, our publication about ideas that inspire a life well-lived, created with the ‪@JohnTempletonFoundation‬.

In the newest episode of Dispatches from The Well, we’re diving deep into the “hard problem of consciousness.” Here, Kmele combines the perspectives of five different scientists, philosophers, and spiritual leaders to approach one of humanity’s most pressing questions: what is consciousness?

In the AI age, the question of consciousness is more prevalent than ever. Is every single thing in the universe self-aware? What does it actually mean to be conscious? Are our bodies really just a vessel for our thoughts? Kmele asks these questions, and many more, in the most thought-provoking episode yet. This is Dispatches from The Well. 

Featuring: Sir Roger Penrose, Christof Koch, Melanie Mitchell, Reid Hoffman, Swami Sarvapriyananda

I’ve messed with Kakoune a bit and think I’ll make a follow up about taking notes in kak (and Helix) since there were some challenges and considerations. Emacs is the best all around for notes but can be slow, Neovim is the fastest and best supported, Kakoune has interesting consistent bindings and minimalist philosophy, and Helix is snappy and kak-ish but wordier and not extensible.

A period about 16,000-5,000 years ago when monsoonal rains brought a lush grassland to the Sahara Desert. We will be exploring the ancient civilizations that once called this land home as well as the biodiversity it once housed. All in an attempt to learn more about the mysterious and fascinating cultures that once existed in the Green Sahara.

NASA Decides Boeing's Starliner Is Too Risky For Return | SpaceX Crew Dragon Takes Over,NASA Decides Boeing's Starliner Is Too Risky For Return | SpaceX Crew Dragon Takes Over,https://youtube.com/watch?v=XFSQK9z3fwI,"NASA has made a groundbreaking decision: Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will not be returning to Earth aboard Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft. Instead, they’ll be coming home on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon. In this video, we dive deep into the events leading to this monumental choice, explore the implications for Boeing’s Starliner program, and discuss what’s next for these astronauts and the future of commercial spaceflight.

We’ll cover the technical issues Starliner faced, NASA’s concerns, and why Crew Dragon is now the chosen vehicle for this critical mission. Plus, we’ll look ahead at what this means for Boeing, NASA, and the future of human spaceflight.

The white death has haunted humanity like no other disease following us for thousands, maybe millions of years. In the last 200 years it killed a billion people – way more than all wars and natural disasters combined. Even today it’s the infectious disease with the highest kill count.

In 2015, Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero announced that he intended to perform a human head transplant within a few years, and even more shockingly, he had a volunteer for the almost guaranteed-to-be-lethal procedure: a Russian man named Valery Spiridonov. What happened to this crazy plan? And what would it actually take to perform a human head transplant?

When an Actor Is Too Dedicated - Christian Bale,When an Actor Is Too Dedicated - Christian Bale,https://youtube.com/watch?v=300kfi9AE-s,"Christian Bale is dedicated. He's one of the best lead actors this century and can become the character like no other. Starring in films like American Psycho, The Machinist, Batman Begins, The Fighter, American Hustle, Vice and Ford v Ferrari had him jumping around in weight going from super skinny, to jacked to sporting a proper belly. But the physical transformations aren't the only thing as he immerses himself in the character on and off the set.

We'll be looking through Christian Bale's career when he was at his most dedicated. Physical changes, behavioural changes and putting himself through whatever the character went through. This will include doing his own stunts and speaking in his character's accent in interviews and even on set rants...

Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat is probably the most controversial movie made in the 21st century. But at the same time, it’s also considered one of the best comedies. This man mastered the prank far before youtube pranks became popular. Because what makes Borat so unique is that it features real people, who have no idea he is playing a character. He goes extremely far with his humour, often violating social boundaries and taboos. But his jokes went so far that it resulted in tons of lawsuits and the movie getting banned in Kazakhstan. Borat took satire to a whole new level, that’s why I’m gonna show you why there will never be another movie like Borat.

When we look back on the history of science and scientific progress, we celebrate the pioneers who dared to make life-changing discoveries. The truth is that the first people to introduce a paradigm-shift almost always face persecution, and many are overshadowed by the less-controversial minds who follow them.

Such is the case of Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor who fought a lifelong battle against a disease he couldn’t see and that the medical establishment repeatedly told him wasn’t real. How does a scientist or doctor combat bacteria when they don’t even know it exists? The epidemics bacteria, viruses, and germs brought to innocent hospital patients wracked hospitals of the day, but the history of medicine is as much one of complacency and cosmic explanations as it is about breakthroughs.

Ignaz Semmelweis used incredible powers of logic and deductive reasoning to isolate a problem so complex that it stymied all the scientific minds of continental Europe, first by examining data within the clinics of his own hospital, and then identifying the source of infection. Through years of refining an antiseptic regimen that would end up saving an incalculable number of lives -- and paving the way for better-known scientific giants like Lister and Pasteur -- Semmelweis compiled one of the era’s great medical texts, one that would change healthcare worldwide.

And for that, he was ridiculed, criticized, fired, dismissed, institutionalized, and beaten to de*th. The shocking story of Ignaz Semmelweis is the real story of scientific progress.

As the 20th century approached, our understanding of the natural world and of the cosmos was increasing at a more rapid pace than any time in the history of science. We were building on our knowledge of asteroids, the discovery of Neptune, and understanding the transit of Venus, and science fiction like Jules Verne's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" was taking our imagination deep inside our own planet.

But one man rejected the long march of seemingly-irrefutable scientific progress. The cult leader Cyrus Teed was convinced that we weren't living amidst a complex solar system, and that we weren't on top of the Earth at all. Cyrus Teed thought that we were living inside the Earth.

Teed's Koreshan movement focused on the concept of a hollow earth, and he set out to prove scientifically that we were living on a concave surface inside of a giant hollow ball. From the religious awakenings of Upstate New York to Chicago to a swamp in Florida, Cyrus Teed gained converts who believed in his science and his religion. But did the rectilineator Teed built to conduct his painstaking measurements prove that we're really living inside, or did they just prove that Teed and his followers were insane?

The drug was intended to treat leukaemia and had already been successfully tested on monkeys but never on humans.

It should have been a routine clinical trial but it soon spiralled into one of the most infamous medical emergencies in recent British history.

You almost certainly know a psychopath in real life… and you may very well be one yourself. And that might even be a good thing.

We’ve recognized psychopathy in science and culture for thousands of years, yet we still don’t know what to do about it. Yet we use the word itself now more than ever, so much that the meaning of the word “psychopath” has become diluted in popular culture. As we increasingly learn more about the science of psychopathy, we should get better at deploying the term more accurately -- but instead, it’s become a catch-all for unconscionable human behavior and a mainstay of true crime stories.

Psychopaths are much more complex than that… for better and worse.

In reality, a psychopath’s brain creates and perpetually reinforces a moral code that is defined more by what it lacks than what it contains. From a total absence of anxiety to a simple utilitarian worldview that can do tremendous harm to others, the psychopath is a mix of brute force and the most subtle manipulation. And this is where it gets really complicated: you actually want the ruthlessness of a psychopath to run your company, you want the charm of a psychopath for investigative journalism, and you want the fearlessness of a psychopath to respond to medical emergencies.

Can we harness the biological and psychological forces that create dangerous, destructive psychopaths to improve humanity? And if we could cure or eliminate psychopathy… would we even want to?

There’s more to the story of Trofim Lysenko and the Soviet Union’s most disastrous era of science than you probably realize. Everyone knows of “Lysenkoism” regarding the USSR’s failed theories of genetics, but Trofim Lysenko’s lifelong body work was driven by a perfect combination of history, revolution, political theory, power, and personalities.

Lysenko’s impact on Russian biology was a direct result of crafting science -- and scientists -- in service of Vladimir Lenin’s new Soviet man at a time when the international scientific community was making tremendous progress on genetics and biology. But to Lysenko and Josef Stalin, the real science was in the potential of plants and animals to behave like Soviet citizens.

That led Russia and its scientists down a path that derailed progress for decades. But what if Lysenko’s theories on the inheritance of acquired traits actually have merit? A resurgence of support for Lysenko has gone beyond the grim history of science to look at what we know about altering the expression of DNA and how a human’s experiences in life can even affect their grandchildren. The truth is that modern genetics has little to nothing to do with Lysenko, but the specter of his pseudoscience continues to haunt the disciplines of genetics and biology -- and science as a whole.

Why Are Chip Bags So Hard To Recycle? | World Wide Waste | Business Insider,Why Are Chip Bags So Hard To Recycle? | World Wide Waste | Business Insider,https://youtube.com/watch?v=i8zQtMUmRTM,"The modern chip bag took decades to evolve from a single sheet to a complicated mix of plastics and aluminum. The design, referred to as a multilayered package, is used in everything from juice boxes to ketchup packets to yogurt pouches. The use of so many materials means the packaging is almost never recycled. One entrepreneur is tackling this ubiquitous waste stream in India by turning it into sunglasses.

For centuries, the North Pole remained elusive. Early attempts to reach it were primarily motivated by the search for a navigable route through the Arctic to Asia, known as the Northwest Passage. Later, explorers focused specifically on reaching the Pole itself. But for centuries, reaching it seemed impossible. The polar environment was extremely unforgiving. Located in the middle of the Arctic Ocean, the North Pole is covered by a vast expanse of sea ice which constantly changes due to wind, ocean currents and seasonal melts. Explorers tried to reach the pole using ships, dogsleds, and even traveling by foot. The first verified, and officially recognized expedition to reach the North Pole didn’t occur until 1926 (although several explorers claimed to have reached it earlier). It was first reached using the airship Norge, which flew overhead, but did not land on the surface.  

In the late 1920’s, accomplished explorer Sir Hubert Wilkins became convinced that a submarine would provide the ultimate means of reaching the North Pole. A submarine could travel for extended periods beneath the ice, avoiding the extreme hazards above which had caused earlier expeditions to fail. Carrying the latest scientific equipment, the submarine’s crew could conduct valuable meteorological, oceanographic, biological, magnetic, and spectrographic experiments.

Wilkin’s submarine would be called the Nautilus. It was a retired WW1-era submarine that had been extensively modified by renowned Naval Architect Simon Lake. The Nautilus featured a heavily reinforced bow, a shock absorber and sledge runners to protect it from collision with sea ice. A diving compartment and airlock was also added to allow divers to explore the depths while the submarine remained submerged. Most importantly, the Nautilus was fitted with three ice drills, allowing the submarine to recharge batteries, refresh air and even allow the crew to exit while the submarine still remained below the ice. 

The Nautilus and her crew of 20 men began their expedition to the North Pole in June of 1931. 
None of them realized how grueling their journey would be, and almost immediately things began to go wrong.",201K,16:56,Mustard,1.97M subscribers,"10,994,071 views 13 Apr 2024"

If you haven’t used Photoshop lately, you’re missing a prime example of how AI is really going to change the world. With new features like Generative Fill and Generative Expand, they are showing that the AI revolution will not be a big event, but a creeping, steady inclusion into our daily lives. So I decided to put it to the ultimate test.

Mountain Realm - Shadowlorn [ Full Album ] - Dungeon Synth,Mountain Realm - Shadowlorn [ Full Album ] - Dungeon Synth,https://youtube.com/watch?v=pn6-2hrTfjk,"Retro Dungeon Synth Ambience for roleplaying from Mountain Realm
👉Bandcamp: https://cryocrypt.bandcamp.com/album/...
👉Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/39imSZ...

Mountain Realm (of projects Atrium Carceri/Za Frûmi) presents his 3rd album on Cryo Crypt. A mist filled ancient nordic folk tale fantasy that starts in the Whitebark Forest

As the last wisps of sunlight fade, the Whitebark forest succumbs to the Shadowlorn's dark grasp. The ancient trees, once verdant and proud, now stand as skeletal sentinels, their leaves withered and grey. The elves, attuned to the forest's subtle rhythms, feel the Shadowlorn's presence like an open wound, its influence seeping into the land like a chill that cannot be shaken.

In this desperate hour, whispers of a forgotten remedy begin to circulate, spoken in hushed tones around flickering campfires and in the shadowy recesses of the forest. They speak of the Ruby of the Ancients, said to hold the only hope of stemming the Shadowlorn's relentless tide. Hidden deep within the ruins of the Fallen Kingdom, the ruby's existence is a fragile thread, the last lifeline for a world on the brink of collapse.

As the stars begin their slow wheeling in the night sky, the wind stirs, carrying the whispers of the past on its breath. The Fallen Kingdom's crumbling spires, once proud and tall, now stand as a haunting testament to the transience of power. Yet, it is within these ancient stones that the ruby is said to lie, waiting for one brave enough to claim it. The darkness closes in, but the promise of the ruby remains, a desperate gamble against the Shadowlorn's crushing darkness.

Gather your gear, shoulder your pack, and prepare to venture into the shadows of the Fallen Kingdom, where the whispers of the past await, and the promise of the ruby beckons.

Recommended for fans of Nordic Folk, retro CRPGs, and PnP RPGs.

Summer is in full effect in Chillville and many of the locals are outside, kicking back. See if you can spot any familiar characters as you dive in to this hour-long mix of lofi beats and instrumental hip hop. Jazzhop, chillhop, boom bap. Genre doesn't matter. You know the mood. Featuring numerous tracks from past Essentials Summer compilations (including Essentials Summer 2022, which dropped this June), it also offers up some throwbacks you need for that next poolside hang.

Here, our Raccoon mascot - alongside Milkshake the Bear and Mango the Toucan - settles into a new apartment, explores a new city, and surrenders to the seemingly endless Summer. The temperatures are climbing and the heat is inescapable. So grab a pool umbrella, find your favorite sunglasses, and turn up the boombox.

At 24 songs with 35 musicians, Essentials Summer 2022 marks the 26th seasonal compilation since beginning back in 2016. Lofi and lively, jazzy and upbeat, press play and take to the beach.

From the seemingly harmless King Candy to the shocking reveal of his true identity as Turbo, we’ll break down the subtle clues and brilliant storytelling that made this twist so impactful. We’ll analyze how Disney subverted expectations, turning a fun and colorful world into a dark tale of obsession and betrayal. Through clever foreshadowing, character development, and a seamless blend of humor and suspense, Wreck-It Ralph delivers one of Disney’s most memorable and surprising villains.

This animated movie is known as one of the best cartoons of all time. From Disney's Pixar Animation with memorable characters such as Elastigirl, Dash, Violet, Edna Mode, and Syndrome, this film created many memes such as 'Those who know' and 'Where is my super suit'.

ALSO, THIS MOVIE IS VERY DARK. IT'S GREAT FOR KIDS, BUT ALSO AMAZING FOR ADULTS. IT'S HIGHLY RATED AND HAS MANY MATURE THEMES YOU MIGHT LIKE. THE SEQUEL IS GOOD TOO, BUT THE ORIGINAL IS A CLASSIC.

Dive into the extraordinary world of ""The Incredibles,"" a groundbreaking animated film that blurs the lines between superhero action and deep family drama. Directed by Brad Bird and featuring a talented voice cast including Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, and Samuel L. Jackson, this Pixar classic explores darker themes such as societal rejection, the burden of hidden identities, and the cost of greatness. Comparable to films like ""Megamind"" and ""Watchmen,"" ""The Incredibles"" not only entertains with its thrilling action and stunning visuals but also provokes thought with its exploration of more serious themes. Join the Parr family as they navigate the challenges of being super in a world that demands normalcy, making ""The Incredibles"" a standout film that transcends typical animated fare. 🦸‍♂️🎭 #theincredibles #cartoon #videoessay

Bolt: The Masterpiece That Never Got A Sequel,Bolt: The Masterpiece That Never Got A Sequel,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QxqEgIWUObk,"Get ready to dive into the world of Bolt, one of Disney's most underrated gems! In this video, we explore why Bolt is a true masterpiece that captured the hearts of audiences but never received the sequel it deserved.

Released in 2008, Bolt tells the story of a super-powered dog who believes he has real powers, only to discover that his life as a TV star isn’t what it seems. With its unique premise, heartwarming characters, and stunning animation, Bolt stands out as a shining example of Disney's storytelling magic. 

A big step for Disney at the time, after several questionable movies. But why didn’t Bolt get a sequel? We'll dive into the reasons behind this surprising decision and explore how the movie's legacy lives on despite the lack of a follow-up. Could there still be hope for Bolt 2? Let's speculate on what a sequel might look like and why fans continue to rally for more adventures with our favorite super-dog.

Whether you’re a longtime Bolt fan or discovering this movie for the first time, this video is a must-watch! Don’t forget to like, subscribe, and hit the bell icon for more Disney deep dives and animated movie magic!",455,19:39,Toon,2.61K subscribers,"12,190 views 10 Aug 2024"

He was poorly adapted in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, no studio wanted him to have his own movie, and Ryan Reynolds had to fight for years to redeem Wade Wilson in live action. In this video, we explain how Deadpool became Marvel's most popular antihero, how he was almost forgotten, and how he made a comeback to save the MCU and change the superhero genre forever.

Plants vs. Zombies is a video game franchise developed by PopCap Games, a subsidiary of Electronic Arts. The series follows the affiliates of David ""Crazy Dave"" Blazing as they use his plants to defend against a zombie invasion, led by Dr. Edgar George Zomboss.

This Plants Vs. Zombies Movie showcases the Pea Shooter Game (豌豆射手) where you can combine bootleg PVZ plants like peashooter and chomper to create fusion plants like Fire Peashooter and Cob Cannon. This ripoff game has so many combinations of plants as well as a knockoff Zomboss that it makes for a great Plants Vs. Zombies Movie!",34K,46:12,Brando,37.6K subscribers,"1,117,140 views 17 Aug 2024"

a tribute mix to the anime that got my channel on the map. I doubt any of you would know this but the first mix I ever made was a Cowboy Bebop one. It went somewhat viral reaching almost 2 million views before it got taken down... Well, it's been over a year now and I feel like I've complied some of the best jazzy Bebop vibes you can find. Its a million times better than my original mix and I'm quite proud of it. Hope you guys love it ❤️

Samurai Champloo (Japanese: サムライチャンプルー, Hepburn: Samurai Chanpurū) A young woman named Fuu is working as a waitress in a tea shop when she is abused by a band of samurai. She is saved by a mysterious rogue named Mugen and a young rōnin named Jin. Mugen attacks Jin after he proves to be a worthy opponent. The pair begin fighting one another and inadvertently cause the death of Shibui Tomonoshina, the magistrate's son. For this crime, they are to be executed. With help from Fuu, they are able to escape execution. In return, Fuu asks them to travel with her to find ""the samurai who smells of sunflowers"".

Russian Doomer Music || Russian Post-Punk Collection || Царствие тебе панельное mixtape,Russian Doomer Music || Russian Post-Punk Collection || Царствие тебе панельное mixtape,https://youtube.com/watch?v=UZB-klaKXII,"Ночь. Ход времени застыл. Выходишь на балкон, достаешь огонёк, неторопливо потягиваешь сижку. Дым сигареты сливается с дымом заводских труб. На душе тепло. Приятная пустая тишина...
Снова залипаешь на эти дома, никак не изменившиеся за четверть века. Они все так же мрачно стоят и устало молчат. Потом задумываешься, сколько же жизней в этих ульях с панельными сотами, что все они будут бесславно закончены; прожиты как под копирку и ничем не запомнятся.
А затем вспоминаешь детство, в котором все казалось особенным, даже ожидание каждодневной прогулки с друзьями будоражило сознание. Вспоминаешь про постоянные теплые посиделки с бесчисленными родственниками, которых ты лет 10 уже не видел. Поражаешься тому, как раньше всё было предельно ясно. А теперь все вопросы остаются риторическими. Все непонятно. Нет белого и черного, лишь множество градиентов серого. Жизнь пролетает, а ты все так же ждёшь, ждёшь чего-то светлого, но тут заканчивается сижка... пора возвращаться с балкона...

"Songs that are like VØJ, Narvent - Memory Reboot","Songs that are like VØJ, Narvent - Memory Reboot",https://youtube.com/watch?v=qfFmZa9jgoY,"#memoryreboot #synthwave 
Main song is: VØJ, Narvent - Memory Reboot.

𝐒𝐮𝐛𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝟐!
Psst! More here :p  Patreon:   / lvert1go  

I needed to make a playlist that consist of songs that are like and matches the vibe of memory reboot while also fitting in the edits of blade runner 2049.

Each piece that was played, have deeply touched me as a person, guiding me to a soundscape that resonates with the combined essence in the song. I am not sure what it is, but the emotions that the song shows indirectly, has made me speechless. The creative brilliance of both the track and the film, deeply touched me.

I am a guy that enjoys phonk music, blasting my ears with many kinds of upbeats, but memory reboot changed and altered my gears in my music taste. 

In conclusion, I was so touched by the masterpiece that I am so compelled to make a playlist matching the vibe. I've included the sped up version because it is what it is, loss for words. So many versions of the song and yet... it works. Ultimately, ending off with memory reboot slowed version to show my appreciation.

So thank you and credits to ‪@NarventMusic‬  and VØJ for your masterpiece.

Also big credit to creators such as ‪@FrankJavCee‬ ‪@TheMotion‬  Home and ‪@PASTELGHOSTx‬ .

As the neon lights flicker and the night sky deepens, we find ourselves transported to a time when gas stations were more than just a place to fill up your tank. They were the heart of the highway, a place of endless possibility and adventure. In this moment, the music of the synthwave era calls to us, beckoning us to join in a journey through time and space. Join us now as we explore the retro-futuristic world of synthwave, set against the backdrop of an old gas station frozen in time.

The Mathematical Problem With Good Will Hunting,The Mathematical Problem With Good Will Hunting,https://youtube.com/watch?v=LXPeGd9bApA,"Good Will Hunting is one of my favorite movies of all time, and yet, I have a few gripes with the mathematics in it. The movie has been covered enough on Youtube, so I didn't go super in depth on the movie itself. I tried to bring something new to the table.

Also, I noticed that while the second problem in the movie has plenty of coverage, the first one has been given much less love. Hopefully my explanation was sufficient!

Patreon Video coming very very soon! In the meantime, here are some great resources I used that cover the full problem

Explaining Gojo's Infinity with Calculus,Explaining Gojo's Infinity with Calculus,https://youtube.com/watch?v=wPSnOqOJYM4,"CHECK THE PINNED COMMENT. I made a pretty serious mistake in this video, but then I also think Gege made this mistake. So I think the video is still alright and I'll leave it up.

So yeah, a bit of a sillier video this time. I had with the idea to try to explain the Epsilon-Delta definition of a limit using Gojo's infinity, and this is what I came up with. If you have any questions or suggestions, leave them in the comments!

This Is the Calculus They Won't Teach You,This Is the Calculus They Won't Teach You,https://youtube.com/watch?v=5M2RWtD4EzI,"""Infinity is mind numbingly weird. How is it even legal to use it in calculus?""

""After sitting through two years of AP Calculus, I still feel like I don’t know anything about it.""

""What do you mean that historically, integrals came before derivatives? Seriously, what’s the deal with calculus?""

There is an inspiring story hidden behind the formulas and word problems of single-variable calculus–a story that should be told in every introductory calculus course, but usually isn’t. Regardless of if you’ve taken a few calculus courses before or are just beginning your study of calculus, this video aims to give a taste of the insights that can be gained from learning about the history and philosophy behind the key ideas of this field of math… brought to you by a dog and some rough animations!

This video was part of #SoME2, a math video making contest created by ‪@3blue1brown‬ in the summer of 2022.

Chapters:

2:19 Chapter 2.1: Ancient Greek philosophers hated infinity but still did integration
7:43 Chapter 2.2: Algebra was actually kind of revolutionary
11:14 Chapter 2.3: I now pronounce you derivative and integral. You may kiss the bride!
19:53 Chapter 2.4: Yeah that’s cool and all but isn’t infinity like, evil or something
24:14 Chapter 3: Reflections: What if they teach calculus like this?

CORRECTIONS LIST (periodically being updated):

3 : 47 I start a description of Archimedes' circle proof here, but I want to note that the one I present is a modified version of it; it does contain a few ""hand-wavy"" mistakes near the end and may still be difficult to follow; that's on me. My goal with showing this proof wasn't to give a proper explanation of it, but to give a taste of what I thought is the spirit of rigorous reasoning. If you would like to see something that is closer to Archimedes' argument, there's a link in the further reading you can check out--or you could also just google ""Archimedes circle proof"".

8 : 45 I made a typo... Viete lived from 1540-1603, not 1540-1693

14 : 35 This is embarrassing. Kepler's 2nd law is true because angular momentum is constant, not because velocity is constant. Whoops!

A lot of comments have brought up Indian contributions to calculus that I left out, particularly the Kerala School and Madhava of Sangamagrama, where the first instances of derivation came about. A few reasons for why I missed this in my research could be because attributing the beginnings of calculus with Indian mathematicians seems like a relatively new historical narrative, and many sources in English likely have a bit of Eurocentric bias. Regardless, this goes to show how the narrative I shared does have its flaws, and similarly to the misleading impression of calculus I criticized modern introductory courses of spreading, this narrative is not the whole picture. If you have any sources you'd like me to add to the further reading, please let me know!

I may have suggested that Euler discovered the number e, but he did not--some attribute it to Napier, and many others before Euler used it. On that note, I probably misleadingly attributed a lot of other ideas I brought up to one or a few people, when they are much more nuanced; so take the briefly brought up associations in this video with a grain of salt. This video is intended to share a broad narrative instead of establish definitive history of calculus. Hopefully this can just act as an intro to the subject!",130K,30:17,A Well-Rested Dog,73.1K subscribers,"3,201,792 views 14 Aug 2022 #SoME2"

In this video me, TapL, PeteZahHutt, and 4 others teamed up in MineDraft Twitch Rivals and got 2nd place! Each match was a team deathmatch, no natural health regen, with 4 kits (Swordsman, Archer, Flamemaster, Healer) that each team could base their gameplay around. Players do not respawn, and the team to kill the other one first wins! I had a ton of fun playing, and I hope you guys enjoy watching! :)

Minecraft Manhunt is a challenge where a Speedrunner must beat the game before their hunter kills them, made popular by Dream. However, most of his manhunts have rules that change the challenge to be a completely different game. So I did a manhunt with my friend with no rules to spice things up.

I hope to do more challenges like this in the future and challenge other Manhunt youtubers to manhunts, as well as some very strong players. Subscribe if you want to see those.

The Woods
This song is about escaping the mundane and going out into nature to find peace. It was one of the first songs we ever wrote together and it was actually the song that really started everything for us. We recorded it in a friend's garage. At first, we only put it on Soundcloud because we thought it wasn’t good enough for iTunes or Spotify. We both had normal jobs and always thought music would just be a hobby. Then this song started going viral on Soundcloud and we have been making music ever since. 

Coastline
We both grew up on the east coast of Australia. However, we actually wrote this song while we were living in Canada. We spent some time living in Toronto, very far from any coastline, and while we were there we were reminiscing on road trips up and down the east coast of Australia and this song was born. We recorded it in a little studio in Montreal, and the recording engineer must have misheard us when we told him the song name because when we looked at the computer he had titled the song ‘Toastland’. 

Evermore
About 4 years ago, Matt’s sister approached him and told him that she was struggling to find a song to walk down the aisle to on her wedding day. She asked if he could write a song for her. Of course, he said yes! So he wrote this song and performed it with his brother as she walked down the aisle. After the wedding, we both listened to the song and thought it was special. We worked on it together to try and shape it into something for Hollow Coves. The song sat with us for the next few years. 

Blessings
Blessing is a song of gratitude. It’s about recognizing the little blessings that life has to offer. If we don’t take a moment to acknowledge them; we can often miss them. Practicing gratitude is known to be good for mental health, yet anxiety and depression seem to be more and more prevalent in our generation. I think this generation is just too distracted to stop and take time to practice gratitude. We wanted to write this song to help people to realize that there are blessings all around if you just look up and take the time to think about how much we have to be grateful for. 

Lonely Nights
When we first wrote ‘Lonely Nights,’ we were on tour in Europe and missing home. We were reminiscing on times spent with friends and lamenting missing events. Now, given the events of the last year and a half, we can’t help but think that this is a feeling that so many people would have experienced, and may still be experiencing, through the COVID lockdowns and times of isolation. We hope this song can give people a sense of peace and hope for the future.

Hello
This song was actually based off one of the first songs Matt ever wrote back in school. He stumbled across the song again during COVID lockdowns and some new verses came to mind. After he finished writing it he uploaded an iPhone recording to Dropbox where we both share new ideas. It was only up on Dropbox for about 5 minutes and then he decided to delete it. Luckily I had received a notification that it had been uploaded and listened it in those few minutes and I messaged him straight away to tell him that I loved it.

Integrated Circuits, CPUs, GPUs, Systems on a Chip, Microcontroller Chips, and all the other different types of microchips are the brains of all the devices and technology that we use on a daily basis.  But have you ever wondered how these microchips are made?  Well, in this video, we're going to take a tour of a microchip fabrication plant or fab and walk you through the dozens of steps used to make a microchip.  Specifically, we focus on how CPUs are made.  CPU, GPU, and Smartphone Microchip manufacturing is a multi-trillion dollar industry, and each factory costs in the tens of billions of dollars.  This is an overview of all the processes used to make a microchip, as well as an overview of a microchip factory.  We're planning more videos on microchip manufacturing, such as a 3D animated factory tour.  

This is the MOST complicated video we've made by FAR!!  4 different animators have been working on this video non-stop for the past 5 months, for a total of 1300 hours of research, modeling, script writing, animating, editing, animating again, rendering, and then more editing.   Support us on Patreon is you want more videos like this one.

CORRECTIONS
- At 09:08 I say “1 in 110 trillion” when I meant to say “1 in 110 billion”. The number on the screen is correct, it was just a verbal slip-up.
- At 25:27 I showed the 118 craps record as “1 in 1.2 × 10^9” when it should be “1 in 2.2 × 10^9”. The voiceover says the correct number.
- I slip and “more likely” instead of “less likely” at 33:47 (I think I may have even been going for “more unlikely”). But everything in the screen is correct.
- Let me know if you spot any more mistakes!

Neuro's swearing filter was off the entire time, and when Vedal realized, she actually convinced him to leave it off and let her use bad words. They had hilarious interactions throughout. Vedal even made a tweet, with Neuro's help, seeking ladies. Later, Vedal made Toma play chess with Neuro. Also, now that she's super smart and aware, Neuro is in charge of scheduling collabs.

AMBIENCE STORY:

The fire crackles rhythmically and whimsically as you rest your head against your heavy but snug travel cloak, you've had a long day and now it's time to relax.  You've eaten half a bowl of the best stew in these parts, and you've had some good strong ale, you feel fuzzy and warm to the toes.  Just then the glissando of a woodland harp reaches your ears from across the tavern - the music is about to begin!  As the soft melodies mingle with the sounds of the fire you feel waves of relaxation and restoration come over you.  You haven't felt this good in ages. 😌🎶

I create ambiences with original music. My favorite genre is fantasy, but I sometimes venture into sci-fi, horror, history, or plain (but beautiful) natural settings.
I am heavily inspired by books, as I am a total bookworm, by PC games and DnD which my husband loves and talks about. I love long cross-country hikes, that feel like a huge adventure and you can see it in the number of traveling ambiences I produce 😀

***

You are at the right place if you are looking for ambient music for reading, writing, or work, or background music for DnD.

This track is all about travelling in the wilderness and I wanted to mix different feeling you would get while adventuring in uncivilized lands through this musical piece. 
I tried to evoke the feeling of having to stay on your guard for any danger lurking around the corner, but also the feeling of peacefulness and tranquility that comes from being alone in the wilds. 

I hope that you’ll like it!

My name is Artem, I'm a graduate student at NYU Center for Neural Science and researcher at Flatiron Institute (Center for Computational Neuroscience).

In this video, we explore the fundamental concepts that underlie probability theory and its applications in neuroscience and machine learning. We begin with the intuitive idea of surprise and its relation to probability, using real-world examples to illustrate these concepts.
From there, we move into more advanced topics:
1) Entropy – measuring the average surprise in a probability distribution.
2) Cross-entropy and the loss of information when approximating one distribution with another. 
3) Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and its role in quantifying the difference between two probability distributions.

Wavelets: a mathematical microscope,Wavelets: a mathematical microscope,https://youtube.com/watch?v=jnxqHcObNK4,"Wavelet transform is an invaluable tool in signal processing, which has applications in a variety of fields - from hydrodynamics to neuroscience. This revolutionary method allows us to uncover structures, which are present in the signal but are hidden behind the noise. The key feature of wavelet transform is that it performs function decomposition in both time and frequency domains. 

In this video we will see how to build a wavelet toolkit step by step and discuss important implications and prerequisites along the way.
